## One project, many repos

After the release of SAMM v2, we moved all of our GitHub content to the {{< external-link "https://github.com/owaspsamm" "OWASP SAMM GitHub organization">}}. Here, you can find all the repositories related to the SAMM project.

<br/><br/>

Some of the repos you can find there are: 
* {{< external-link "https://github.com/owaspsamm/core" "Core Model">}} 
* {{< external-link "https://github.com/owaspsamm/website" "Website">}} 
* {{< external-link "https://github.com/owaspsamm/sammwise" "SAMMwise (assessment tool)">}} 

<br/>

Also, don't miss the {{< external-link "https://github.com/orgs/owaspsamm/discussions/" "Discussions">}} section, where you can pitch your ideas, ask questions, and provide feedback.
