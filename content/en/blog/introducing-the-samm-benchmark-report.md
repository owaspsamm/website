## Unlocking New Insights in Application Security


The world of software security evolves rapidly, with new challenges and best practices emerging every day. For organizations striving to build robust application security programs, the ability to compare practices and measure progress against industry peers is invaluable. This is where the **SAMM Benchmark Report** steps in—a comprehensive analysis based on real-world data that provides actionable insights into the current state of application security maturity.

### Why This Report Matters
This report is more than just numbers and graphs. It’s a window into the strategies, strengths, and challenges faced by organizations of all sizes. By exploring key trends and scores across the five SAMM business functions, this report offers a clear view of how organizations are tackling application security.
For instance, did you know that Operations consistently scores the highest, while Verification struggles to gain traction? Or that third-party assessments often yield higher maturity scores than self-assessments, defying expectations? These insights highlight both progress and areas for growth in the field.
