  In the presentation I'll tell you how I've designed, deployed and led an application security program using SAMM. I'll do this by explaining: 1.- How to establish a baseline and associate it with a risk profile of the organization according to assesment results. - 2.- How to define the organizational objective based on the reduction or mitigation of identified risks. 3.- How to establish an evolutionary roadmap that takes us to the set objective, achieving improvements per quarter. 4.- How to create and lead initiatives and projects that allow us to achieve the objectives set. 5.- How these initiatives allow us to move from an sdlc to an s-sdlc, positively impacting the digital transformation of the company with the integration of the Sec in DevOps, turning it into DevSecOps
