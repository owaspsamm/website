name: "Soft Challenges, Hard Impact: Launching AppSec with OWASP SAMM"
speaker: Nariman AGA-TAGIYEV

affiliation: Secure Habits
role: Cybersecurity Architect
abstract: |
  Starting an application security program is rarely blocked by technology - it is most often slowed down by soft challenges such as alignment, communication, and stakeholder buy-in. OWASP SAMM offers a strong framework for structuring an AppSec strategy, but the real impact comes from how we manage people, priorities, and processes in the early stages.
  
  This session focuses on the non-technical side of SAMM adoption. We will explore how to organize and run effective kickoff meetings, choose workshop formats that engage diverse stakeholders, and create momentum that bridges security and business goals. Real-world lessons will be shared on addressing resistance, balancing perspectives, and turning initial conversations into lasting progress.
  
  Attendees will leave with practical techniques to tackle the soft challenges that determine success or failure, and a playbook for ensuring their AppSec program delivers hard impact with OWASP SAMM.
