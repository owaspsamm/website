## Vienna SAMM & DSOMM User Day 

Join us in Vienna, Austria, on June 24 for the SAMM & DSOMM User Day, a full day dedicated to learning, sharing, and connecting with the community.

This event brings together practitioners, teams, and experts working with SAMM and DSOMM to exchange real-world experiences, explore practical use cases, and discuss how these models are applied across different organizations and contexts.
