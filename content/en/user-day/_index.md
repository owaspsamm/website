## Washington DC Upcoming SAMM & DSOMM User Day

The OWASP SAMM team is excited to announce our upcoming User Day, this time teaming up with {{< external-link "https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/" "DSOMM">}}, as part of {{< external-link "https://owasp.glueup.com/event/owasp-2025-global-appsec-usa-washington-dc-131624/" "Global AppSec USA (Washington, DC)">}}, on November 5th, 2025.

We’ll be spending the day sharing experiences, exploring real-world use of SAMM and DSOMM, and learning from each other about how to advance software security maturity. Whether you're deep into assessments or just getting started, we’d love to hear your perspective.
