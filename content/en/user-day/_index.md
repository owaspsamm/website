## Washington DC SAMM & DSOMM User Day 

The OWASP SAMM team teamed up with {{< external-link "https://owasp.org/www-project-devsecops-maturity-model/" "DSOMM">}} for a special User Day, as part of {{< external-link "https://owasp.glueup.com/event/owasp-2025-global-appsec-usa-washington-dc-131624/" "Global AppSec USA (Washington, DC)">}}, on November 5th, 2025.

We spent the day sharing experiences, exploring real-world use of SAMM and DSOMM, and learning from each other about how to advance software security maturity.
