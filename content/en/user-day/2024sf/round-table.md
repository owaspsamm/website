    Join us for an engaging discussion where we'll focus on SAMM assessment methodology. We'll use this session as a platform for practitioners to exchange their experiences on how they perform SAMM assessments. From roles involved, to challenges and best practices.

    We invite you to bring your questions, insights, and experiences to the table. This is a great opportunity to actively participate in the SAMM community, learn from your peers, and contribute to the collective knowledge that drives software security.
