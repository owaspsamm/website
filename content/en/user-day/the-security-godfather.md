  Everyone! You will always remember this day as the day that changed how you view security and leadership. Today, we gather the family to uncover the hidden power of a Security Champion Program. Many say security is a job for specialists, but what if I told you that security is everyone’s business—just like loyalty and trust are the foundations of a family?

  Think of your champions as your capos—trusted lieutenants who carry out the family’s protection. Without them, your defenses are weak, your territory vulnerable. But with them? Your business becomes an impenetrable fortress, united by a shared cause.

  Remember, every great empire is built by those who protect it from within. So, today, we’re not just talking about security—we’re creating a family. Together, we’ll uncover strategies to build a network of loyal champions who will guard your organization’s most valuable assets.

  This is the inside knowledge that will make your security program untouchable. Not all power comes from the top; it’s the champions you trust who hold the keys to the family’s safety.

  Don’t miss this chance to strengthen the family. This session is an offer you can’t refuse!

bio: |
  My career has taken me through a diverse journey, spanning roles that include full-stack developer, business analyst, IT manager, and now thriving in cybersecurity. Throughout this journey, my passion for technology has remained a constant driving force.

  For me, security resembles solving a 10,000-piece puzzle that's been turned upside down. You understand the end goal, yet you're uncertain about where each piece belongs. Achieving this requires close collaboration with developers, business stakeholders, and others, necessitating me to consistently bridge different disciplines within technology. Whether it's simplifying intricate development concepts for security and business professionals or vice versa, every piece added brings us nearer to the solution. This challenge deeply motivates me.

  I approach my work with a clear focus on prioritizing people first, followed by refining processes, and then technology to enhance these efforts. This philosophy ensures that technological changes are seamlessly integrated and embraced by our teams and organizations.
