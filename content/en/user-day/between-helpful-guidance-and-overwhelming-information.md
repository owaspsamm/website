abstract: |
  In the last two years, we started using OWASP SAMM at several clients with multiple teams. In this talk, we will report our experiences with the framework from the perspektive of different teams with various maturity. We will discuss the guidance SAMM offers, the biggest issues when ramping up a new organization and things we do different today than we did some years ago. 
  The talk gives some perspectives of security professionals relatively new to SAMM and hopefully will contribute to some discussions afterwards.
