  Application security isn’t just about policies and tools—it’s about habits. How can we ensure that security activities like threat modeling, secure code reviews, and vulnerability management become second nature for development teams? In this talk, we’ll explore how Charles Duhigg’s Habit Loop can be applied to embed security into daily workflows.
  We’ll break down how to design effective security cues, establish repeatable security routines, and reinforce habits with meaningful rewards. Using real-world examples, attendees will learn practical strategies to integrate security seamlessly into software development—without adding friction or overwhelming teams.
  Join this session to discover how behavioral science can turn security best practices into lasting habits!
