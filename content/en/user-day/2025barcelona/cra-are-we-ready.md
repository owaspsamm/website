  The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) has come into effect, introducing a transition period after which all products with digital components must comply with its regulations. Maturity models can help organizations evaluate their readiness for the CRA by mapping out key processes. This presentation uses OWASP SAMM to outline the processes required for CRA compliance and compares this "CRA-ready" framework with current industry benchmarks. The findings reveal that the industry is not yet prepared for the CRA. Many companies will need to improve critical security activities, such as Architecture Assessment and Requirement-Driven Testing, to meet the legislationâ€™s requirements. The CRA-ready framework developed in this research can help organizations assess their readiness, identify gaps, lower compliance costs, and minimize the risk of non-compliance.
