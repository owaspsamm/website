  In today's fast-paced digital landscape, the imperative of integrating security seamlessly into the software development lifecycle has become paramount. DevSecOps, a paradigm that champions this integration, alongside the proactive approach of ""Shift Left,"" are concepts that have permeated the industry lexicon. Yet, while their significance is widely acknowledged, the challenge lies in charting a course for continuous improvement.

  Determining the specific areas where an organization can enhance its security posture often elicits a sense of uncertainty. This is where the strategic utilization of established maturity models, such as the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) and the DevSecOps Maturity Model (DSOMM), becomes indispensable. These frameworks provide a structured methodology for assessing and advancing an organization's DevSecOps capabilities.

  A pivotal aspect of these models is their emphasis on governance. In this conference, we will delve into the governance expectations outlined by these models, examining the various implementation strategies and their respective advantages and disadvantages. By exploring these facets, we aim to equip attendees with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions about their DevSecOps initiatives.

  Ultimately, the goal is to provide actionable insights that facilitate the development of comprehensive roadmaps towards DevSecOps maturity. These roadmaps will serve as guiding frameworks, enabling organizations to systematically elevate their security practices and foster a culture of security throughout the software development lifecycle.
