OpenCRE stands for Open Common Requirement Enumeration, and it aims to provide a common language and framework for mapping and comparing different security standards, guidelines, and frameworks. By linking SAMM to OpenCRE, we’ve made it easier for our users to find relevant and useful resources with every stream, as well as to see how SAMM aligns with other security standards such as NIST SSDF, ISO27K, PCI-DSS, OWASP ASVS, and NIST 800-53.</description></item><item><title>Determining scope when implementing SAMM</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2023/05/24/determining-scope-when-implementing-samm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 May 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2023/05/24/determining-scope-when-implementing-samm/</guid><description>When performing a SAMM assessment, should the scope be the whole organization or should it be smaller, like a business unit or even a single team or application?
The short answer? Start small.
Getting started Start by evaluating your goals. What do you want to achieve?
Do you aim to identify and prioritize areas of improvement in your organization&amp;rsquo;s security posture? Do you seek to establish a baseline for measuring the effectiveness of your security program over time?</description></item><item><title>How ISO and SAMM complement each other</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2023/03/21/how-iso-and-samm-complement-each-other/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2023/03/21/how-iso-and-samm-complement-each-other/</guid><description>October 2022 brought us the third revision of the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.
The revisions included simplifying the domains and controls, using more practical language, and introducing new controls. The addition of a separate control for &amp;ldquo;Secure Coding.&amp;rdquo; provides an opportunity to highlight how OWASP SAMM and ISO 27001 are complementary standards.
In this blog post, we shine light on how they intersect and how, implemented together, you can maximize their effectiveness and value.</description></item><item><title>The "Not Applicable" Question</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2023/02/28/the-not-applicable-question/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2023/02/28/the-not-applicable-question/</guid><description>The Core Team&amp;rsquo;s Thoughts Since the initial publication of SAMM 2.0, several SAMM users have asked how to address Activities or Quality Criteria they believe are not applicable to their assessment’s scope. At the recent SAMM Core Team Summit in Boston, we discussed this question at some length, and this article summarizes that conversation. The topic really involves several questions, which we’ll address one at a time.
Is it valid to declare an Activity Not Applicable?</description></item><item><title>Tackling App Security with SAMM-NIST SSDF Mapping</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2023/02/06/samm-ssdf-mapping/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2023/02/06/samm-ssdf-mapping/</guid><description>The Application Security Challenge The increasing dependence on software in our daily lives has made the challenge of ensuring its security more pressing. Despite being a critical concern, cybersecurity is often not a priority for organizations until there is an incident or breach. This has resulted in the cost of cyber insurance doubling in the past two years and the total cost of cybercrime in 2022 reaching $7 trillion .</description></item><item><title>Introducing SAMM Practitioners</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2022/12/05/introducing-samm-practitioners/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2022/12/05/introducing-samm-practitioners/</guid><description>Why SAMM Practitioners? We want to adopt OWASP SAMM 2.0 at my workplace. Can you recommend a company to help us do this?
SAMM team members get asked this a lot through the different channels of communication like our Slack channel and the contact form on the website.
Obviously, we know many companies, organizations, and individuals who can do this. We are a community-driven project and a number of volunteers have contributed to SAMM so it wasn’t an easy answer for us to provide.</description></item><item><title>Addressing Log4J vulnerabilities with SAMM</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2022/02/07/addressing-log4j-vulnerabilities-with-samm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2022/02/07/addressing-log4j-vulnerabilities-with-samm/</guid><description>It’s that dreaded notification. The one that holds the threat, and later the reality, of many sleepless nights. The newest vulnerability is here and its severity is considered critical.
This Log4J vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has caused quite the stir, and rightfully so. It’s kept security peeps on our toes for the last few months so it was interesting to see this topic come up during our last SAMM monthly community call.</description></item><item><title>OWASP SAMM Train the Trainer</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/11/30/owasp-samm-train-the-trainer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/11/30/owasp-samm-train-the-trainer/</guid><description>Expanding awareness of OWASP SAMM To introduce new users to the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM), the SAMM project team has presented their one-day overview training class several times each year.

The instructors for that training class - currently titled &amp;ldquo;Secure Your SDLC using OWASP SAMM - ASAP!&amp;rdquo; - have usually been the project&amp;rsquo;s leaders, Sebastien (Seba) Deleersnyder and Bart de Win, or other SAMM team members.</description></item><item><title>Towards a well-governed SAMM Suite</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/03/23/samm-suite/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/03/23/samm-suite/</guid><description>Improving the velocity of OWASP SAMM Some years back, SAMM was a typical old school documentation project. Creation of all the documents was a purely manual and error-prone process. We fought a very complicated manual build procedure of the project PDF which only a few people knew how to deal with. Already fixed errors kept reappearing and it was hard to know who actually had the latest version in their mailbox.</description></item><item><title>OWASP SAMM Roadmap</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/02/09/owasp-samm-roadmap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2021/02/09/owasp-samm-roadmap/</guid><description>What happened in 2020? This was a special year but still a lot happened for SAMM. The team worked hard to continue delivering and adding value for our users.
New version, new website, new ways of getting together In 2020 we launched OWASP SAMM v2.0, more than 10 years after OpenSAMM v1.0 was launched on March 25th, 2009 by Pravir Chandra.
Throughout 2020 we developed and released a new website and promoted the launch of SAMM v2.</description></item><item><title>Comparing BSIMM &amp; SAMM</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/10/29/comparing-bsimm-and-samm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/10/29/comparing-bsimm-and-samm/</guid><description>Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM) compared to Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) A common origin BSIMM (Building Security In Maturity Model) and SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) have similar origins dating back to a common origin back in 2008-2009. I’m frequently asked about what is similar and what is different between the two models, so I wrote up this comparison to help organizations understand which of these two models may be a better fit for their needs.</description></item><item><title>SAMM is doing CI/CD</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/03/31/samm-is-doing-cicd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/03/31/samm-is-doing-cicd/</guid><description>What version 2 brought along A significant change that happened behind the scenes for SAMM 2.0 was the addition of a CI/CD pipeline, the automated version of all the steps we need to deliver SAMM. It has enhanced our productivity, providing standardization and enabling faster iterations. At the core of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are speed of delivery, reliability, and visibility. This process encourages frequent updates, allows quick fixes, and ensures a set of checks before deployment.</description></item><item><title>OWASP SAMM version 2 - public release</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/01/31/samm2-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/blog/2020/01/31/samm2-release/</guid><description>After three years of preparation, our SAMM project team has delivered version 2 of SAMM!

SAMM stands for Software Assurance Maturity Model.
Our mission is to provide an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture. We want to raise awareness and educate organizations on how to design, develop, and deploy secure software through our self-assessment model. SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle and is technology and process agnostic. We built SAMM to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature, as there is no single recipe that works for all organizations.</description></item><item><title>Acronyms and Abbreviations</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/acronyms-and-abbreviations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/acronyms-and-abbreviations/</guid><description> &amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;AA&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt;

New security features and patches are regularly released for the various elements of the technology stack you&amp;rsquo;re using, until they become obsolete or are no longer supported.
Most of the technologies in any application stack are not secure by default. This is frequently intentional, to enhance backwards compatibility or ease of setup. For this reason, ensuring the secure operation of the organization&amp;rsquo;s technology stack requires the consistent application of secure baseline configurations to all components.</description></item><item><title>Events and trainings</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/events/</guid><description>Featured Check out these presentations by our project leaders.

In this model, we define a security incident as a breach, or the threat of an imminent breach, of at least one asset&amp;rsquo;s security goals, whether due to malicious or negligent behavior. Examples of security incidents might include: a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a cloud application, an application user accessing private data of another by abusing a security vulnerability, or an attacker modifying application source code.</description></item><item><title>Incident Response</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/incident-management/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/incident-management/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Mapping SAMM 1.5 to 2.0</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/mapping-versions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/mapping-versions/</guid><description>Overview For those organizations using 1.0 or 1.5 versions of SAMM it&amp;rsquo;s important to take the time to understand how the framework has evolved.

Although these functions are not performed directly by an application, the overall security of the application and its data depends on their proper performance. Deploying an application on an unsupported operating system with unpatched vulnerabilities, or failing to store backup media securely, can make the protections built into that application irrelevant.
The functions covered by this practice include, but are not limited to: system provisioning, administration, and decommissioning; database provisioning and administration; and data backup, restore, and archival.</description></item><item><title>Operations</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/</guid><description>The Operations Business Function encompasses those activities necessary to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability are maintained throughout the operational lifetime of an application and its associated data. Increased maturity with regard to this Business Function provides greater assurance that the organization is resilient in the face of operational disruptions, and responsive to changes in the operational landscape.</description></item><item><title>Organization and Culture</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/education-and-guidance/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/education-and-guidance/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Patching and Updating</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/environment-management/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/operations/environment-management/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Policy and Compliance</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/policy-and-compliance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/policy-and-compliance/</guid><description>The Policy and Compliance (PC) practice focuses on understanding and meeting external legal and regulatory requirements while driving internal security standards to ensure compliance in a way that’s aligned with the business purpose of the organization.
A driving theme for improvement within this practice is describing organization’s standards and 3rd party obligations as application requirements, enabling efficient and automated audits that may be leveraged within the SDLC and continuously demonstrate that all expectations are met.</description></item><item><title>Policy and Standards</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/policy-and-compliance/stream-a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/policy-and-compliance/stream-a/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Quick start guide for version 2.0</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/guidance/quick-start-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/guidance/quick-start-guide/</guid><description>About OWASP SAMM OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) is the OWASP framework to help organizations assess, formulate, and implement a strategy for software security, that can be integrated into their existing Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

It does so by incrementally building a set of security test and regression cases and executing them regularly.
A key aspect of this practice is its attention to both positive and negative testing. The former verifies that the application&amp;rsquo;s security controls satisfy stated security requirements and validates their correct functioning.</description></item><item><title>SAMM Agile Guidance</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/guidance/agile/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/guidance/agile/</guid><description>Overview This document explains how SAMM security practices work for Agile to attain the continuous building in of sufficient security during software development.

Self-assessment Your first step towards improvement is to measure where you are now.
You will typically start with a self-assessment to get an overview on the status of software security activities in your organization.</description></item><item><title>SAMM Assessment Guide</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/assessment-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/assessment-guide/</guid><description>Assessment guidelines and best practices In this section, we offer guidelines and best practices for conducting SAMM assessments. As a bonus, there&amp;rsquo;s a link to a set of interview questions at the end.
The goal of a SAMM assessment The primary goal for a SAMM assessment is to evaluate the current software posture. To achieve this goal, you need to gather and evaluate information regarding the various activities described by SAMM.</description></item><item><title>SAMM Practitioners</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/practitioners/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/practitioners/</guid><description>Who to contact for SAMM services Who is a SAMM practitioner?

Secure Architecture Design looks at the selection and composition of components that form the foundation of your solution, focusing on its security properties. Technology Management looks at the security of supporting technologies used during development, deployment and operations, such as development stacks and tooling, deployment tooling, and operating systems and tooling.</description></item><item><title>Secure Build</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-build/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-build/</guid><description>The Secure Build (SB) practice emphasises the importance of building software in a standardised, repeatable manner, and of doing so using secure components, including 3rd party software dependencies.
The first stream focuses on removing any subjectivity from the build process by striving for full automation. An automated build pipeline can include additional automated security checks such as SAST and DAST to gain further assurance and flag security regressions early by failing the build, for example.</description></item><item><title>Secure Deployment</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-deployment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-deployment/</guid><description>One of the final stages in delivering secure software is ensuring the security and integrity of developed applications are not compromised during deployment. The Secure Deployment (SD) practice focuses on this. To this end, the practice’s first stream focuses on removing manual error by automating the deployment process as much as possible, and making its success contingent upon the outcomes of integrated security verification checks. It also fosters Separation of Duties by making adequately trained, non-developers responsible for deployment.</description></item><item><title>Security Requirements</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/</guid><description>The Security Requirements (SR) practice focuses on security requirements that are important in the context of secure software. A first type deals with typical software-related requirements, to specify objectives and expectations to protect the service and data at the core of the application. A second type deals with requirements relative to supplier organizations that are part of the development context of the application, in particular for outsourced development. It is important to streamline the expectations in terms of secure development because outsourced development can have significant impact on the security of the application.</description></item><item><title>Security Testing</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/security-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/verification/security-testing/</guid><description>The Security Testing (ST) practice leverages the fact that, while automated security testing is fast and scales well to numerous applications, in-depth testing based on good knowledge of an application and its business logic is often only possible via slower, manual expert security testing. Each stream therefore has one approach at its core.
The first stream focuses on establishing a common security baseline to automatically detect so-called &amp;ldquo;low hanging fruit&amp;rdquo;. Progressively customize the automated tests for each application and increase their frequency of execution to detect more bugs and regressions earlier, as close as possible to their inception.</description></item><item><title>Software Dependencies</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-build/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/implementation/secure-build/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Software Requirements</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-a/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Strategy and Metrics</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/strategy-and-metrics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/strategy-and-metrics/</guid><description>Software assurance entails many different activities and concerns. Without an overall plan, you might be spending a lot of effort to build in security, while in fact your efforts may be unaligned, disproportional or even counterproductive. The goal of the Strategy and Metrics (SM) practice is to build an efficient and effective plan for realizing your software security objectives within your organization.
A software security program, that selects and prioritizes activities of the rest of the model, serves as the foundation for your efforts.</description></item><item><title>Stream Guidance</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/stream-guidance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/stream-guidance/</guid><description>Guidance per Stream in the model What’s SAMM guidance? SAMM is a prescriptive security maturity model that is technology, process, and organization agnostic. The model fits any software development process, industry or environment. However, thanks to that, the prescriptive advice is high level by design. That&amp;rsquo;s where we bring the guidance documents into play. Their purpose is to provide concrete examples and recommendations to help organizations kickstart their security assurance programme based on SAMM.</description></item><item><title>Supplier Security</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/security-requirements/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Supporters</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/supporters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/supporters/</guid><description>Organizations supporting SAMM These are companies and organizations who support and have supported SAMM in a variety of ways.

From details about threats and likely attacks against each project, the organization as a whole operates more effectively through better decisions about prioritization of initiatives for security. Additionally, decisions for risk acceptance are more informed, therefore better aligned to the business.
By starting with simple threat models and building application risk profiles, an organization improves over time.</description></item><item><title>Threat Modeling</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/threat-assessment/stream-b/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/design/threat-assessment/stream-b/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Training and Awareness</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/Governance/Education%20&amp;%20Guidance/stream-A/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/Governance/Education%20&amp;%20Guidance/stream-A/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Training and Awareness</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/education-and-guidance/stream-a/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/model/governance/education-and-guidance/stream-a/</guid><description/></item><item><title>User Day</title><link>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/cfp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/user-day/cfp/</guid><description>2024 SAMM User Day!
