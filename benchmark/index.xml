SAMM offers a structured, measurement-driven approach to improving software security. It helps organizations assess and elevate their software security maturity on a scale from 0 to 3. However, many organizations face challenges after completing their initial SAMM assessment. There’s growing interest in understanding how other organizations are progressing, making real-world data one of the hottest topics in the SAMM community.</description></item></channel></rss>
